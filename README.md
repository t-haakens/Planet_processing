# Planet_processing

This repository contains scripts for processing of Planetscope imagery.
Code is based on notebooks from Planetlabs, available here: https://github.com/planetlabs/notebooks

The preprocessing script will:
- Read multiple scenes
- Convert TOA Radiance to TOA Reflectance
- Create mosaic and clip over area of interest (AOI).
